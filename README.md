# Food_Recommender_Chatbot
Built a smart Food Recommender Chatbot using Python, NLP, and Tkinter GUI!
The bot takes user input in natural language (like “I want something with paneer and butter”)
Then it intelligently extracts ingredients, matches them with a real restaurant menu dataset
and returns dish names, restaurant names, prices, and ratings — all from data!

✅ Key tech used:
  Tkinter for GUI
  NLTK for ingredient extraction
  Pandas for dataset filtering
